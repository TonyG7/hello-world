First repository

Hello there!

So I'm basically here following the guide, so here's a little bit about myself.
I enjoy to learn about computer related topics and now I'm currently on a journey into the coding world and I'll be honest, I do enjoy this very much for it's completely different than just knowing the latest CPU, MOBO, GPU ect.
